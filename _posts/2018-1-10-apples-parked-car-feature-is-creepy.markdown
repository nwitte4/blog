I have a few starting thoughts. One, I opened my phone this morning to type in a location of a coffee shop in Center City and the second item in my list is the (correct) location of my car parked 59 miles away. The first item in my list is the location that I've walked to every day for the past three months so that checks out. Two, both of these sentences are literally ridiculous but I typed them without a second thought. My 5x2 cellphone knows that my car is parked in my driveway in New Jersey and it also knows how long it will take me to walk to the area I frequented for 3 months. So as I'm staring at it, I wonder, well how *exactly* does it know? I invite you to follow me down the rabbit hole...

First thing's first, frequent locations is involved. Iphone introduced frequent locations back in
