Ya girl got a job! To be clear, I got the job because I put the work in to develop my technical skills and also created a thoughtful presentation for my interview. I worked very hard to get here and am very proud of myself. And while I believe in my abilities as a programmer, I don't think I would have landed this job without the skillset I amassed from majoring in English.

Back in May 2017, I graduated from Haverford College with a BA in English. I graduated with the intention of attending a programming bootcamp, something I had decided during the winter break of my senior year. After this decision, I went on to complete my senior thesis, *The Functionality of Gallows Humor in Phil Klay's Redeployment*. In addition to completing and handing in my thesis, I had to complete the second half of our thesis requirement which was a Comprehensive Oral Exam.

In order to prepare for the oral exam, each senior has to compile a list of 2 texts taken from each class you've completed as an English Major. You have some leeway with your choices because each class usually used between 5-15 texts and if you took excess classes you had even more leeway. Either way, you end up with a list of 22 texts that you must categorize into three groups with a small description of why you've developed that category. Before the exam you must hand in your final thesis, a list of each course you've taken to satisfy your requirements with your texts, the categorized version of those texts, an abstract statement of your thesis and a reflective statement about your process as a whole.

Eventually, you show up to your hour long exam where you are asked to discuss and answer questions first about your thesis and second about your compiled list. The three professors present are allowed to ask you anything pertaining to those things and sometimes they throw a curveball in there. You have to know your sh*t.

The point of this digression is this: for four years, I thought like an English Major. I researched and compiled information and presented it in a clear and succinct manner. In addition to that, I learned how to articulate my thoughts while speaking to a crowd. I learned how to answer questions while thinking on the fly. I think these are indispensable skills and I'm extremely grateful for my degree and my education. I feel comfortable creating a presentation and I feel comfortable presenting to people who are above me and who are critiquing me. Beyond all this it might be enlightening to mention I suffer from stage fright; these are no small accomplishments for me.

All of these things helped me secure my first job in tech. Not only was I able to showcase my technological skills and what I have learned, but the English Major in me was simultaneously performing. Before I secured this job, I attended a "speed interview" process as a part of NYCDA where I participated in 16 three-minute "speed interviews". I was surprised at how many people commented on how excited I seemed to be there (because I was obviously super nervous) but I think I've come a long way in the past few years and I'm grateful for the skills I have.
