Happy new year!!! This post is mostly just a celebratory thing. I finished my first fully functional app, solo style. This isn't the first app I've built on my own persay.. but! it IS my final project and my first fullstack application that I dreamt up myself and brought to fruition. It's a babysitting app called SitterSetter and you can check it out [here](https://secret-everglades-72811.herokuapp.com/) or on github [here](https://github.com/nwitte4/sitterapp).

The short story is that my first job ever was as a babysitter. Babysitting is great because as long as the human race continues, it means people will want other people to watch their kids from time to time. Basically, I don't really foresee babysitting going out of style.

That being said, scheduling can sometimes be a b**** (censoring for the children, of course) for both the parent and the babysitter. The app I created allows babysitters and parents to connect and do all the babysitting stuff in one place. Each user gets their own calendar. Parents can add/delete their babysitters (you have to add them by their email, similar to something like snapchat or instagram, it's mostly so sitters aren't being added by random people from an open sourced list, I'm rambling now) create/delete babysitting gigs (where they can include a title, start and end time, cost and description with any needed information), request specific sitters at specific times, and leave notes about that sitter that might be helpful for other parents.

Sitters can see any parents that have authorized them and their open gigs. All open gigs are green and all red gigs are taken by someone else. Sitters can claim green(open) or drop gigs to reopen them for someone else, accept/deny specific requests from specific parents, and delete parents.

TLDR: Parents and babysitters now have an easy way to schedule and confirm babysitting gigs. I made it by myself. I feel great about it.
