So a little backstory here. Back in October, I attended an event called Inclusion Hack Job Fair where I was matched with a company. Full disclosure, I was unaware that people were being matched for interviews, I thought this was more of a meet and greet situation. So I go into the room ready to chit chat and suddenly one of the two (very kind) people in front of me asks me if he can ask me some technical questions.

Now, internally I am panicking slightly but externally I keep my cool (I think). I answered to the best of my ability and it went better than I expected. I didn't know what a pure function was, [but now I do](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)(this site/this guy in particular was very helpful). I also didn't know how to articulate the difference between a class and an object, but now I do.

Fast forward a little bit and I get an email from that company asking if I'm still interested in the position, to which I say yes. I hadn't completed my program yet but I was 2 weeks away from doing so and about to start my job search. I really liked the people I spoke to and I was excited to experience the application process. After sending in my application, I was asked to move to the next part of their process: the tech assignment.

I was honestly surprised by how frightened it made me to open that assignment. After staring at it for a little while I started it over the holidays and worked when I could find the time between visiting family. When I returned home I sat down and didn't move for a few hours and ensured the product I returned did what it was expected. Long story short, I didn't end up getting the job for reasons I might never know. Maybe I didn't have enough work experience (I have none in tech) or maybe my code wasn't clean enough (I tend to be verbose) or maybe there was just someone who sent in their application before me and the timing wasn't right.

Point is, it doesn't matter because I got to learn more and get better. I learned about [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and more about API calls and [XMLHttpRequests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest). So while I didn't get the job, I still improved and I'm still excited to continue applying. I also emailed the company back in hopes of learning what I could've done better; I figured it cant hurt and my pal and success coach Clay Wert (hey man) told me "Feedback and a rejection can be the best gift" so fingers crossed that I hear back. I would really love to be able to grow from my mistakes so that when the next interview comes, I can knock it out of the park; a girl can dream.
