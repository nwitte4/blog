Two things.

I was recently told during an interview that my blog reflects the English Major in me. Two more things. One: someone read my blog! Fame and fortune here I come! Kidding, number two: it's actually really awesome to hear that someone took the time to learn more about you beyond the barely customizable lines on a resume. It also tells a lot about a company (in my opinion) and their culture. I feel like resumes reduce you to a number in their pipeline but when you put in the time to show them you're more than a resume (with a blog, a website, a github, etc.) and they put in the time to ensure you're more than a resume... they're probably a great place to work at with great people.

So that is some advice (?) from me, but it is not the advice I was recently given. I digress.

The advice I was recently given was "when you feel awful about yourself and like you've hit a wall and imposter syndrome sets in hard, you're about to get So. Much. Better". I had one of those mind explosions where I thought to myself, "I've never thought about it that way and yet that's exactly what my experience has been but put into the proper words".

When you enter the tech world, people talk a lot about [imposter syndrome](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/developers-how-to-overcome-imposter-syndrome-48edee803cf4) (my favorite quote from this article is: "put yourself in an environment where youâ€™re the dumbest person in the room."). When you enter the tech world via bootcamp, people *really* emphasize it because the likelihood of you feeling it is probably 10x greater due to the significantly smaller amount of time in an formally educational tech space. However, the usual banter sounds something like "imposter syndrome is real, push through it!" or "you're all going to feel imposter syndrome, it's a normal part of the job, don't let it get you down" or "I've been in the industry for x amount of years and I still get imposter syndrome".

What's great about the way this advice was framed is the clear resolution. The previous mentions all tell you to push through, keep going, don't let it get to you but no one tells you *why* you shouldn't let it get to you. Sure, maybe the "why" is obvious to some people: because it's not true and you ARE a developer and you ARE good enough.

This advice digs a little deeper into the issue by giving you the motivation to push through the incessant voice in your head by informing you that the incessant voice is just a sign of improvement. It's just a sign that you're about to break through to the next level of programming. You're about to *get it* even more than you already do.

I thought back to when I first encountered javascript and realized that's exactly how I felt. "I can't do this", "I wasn't cut out for this", "This is too hard", "I'm not smart enough", blah blah blah blah blah. Now, JS is my preferred language and it's clear to me that I was actually about to get a lot better. It's happened a bunch of times since then, and each time I reach that edge of, "This is the thing that's finally going to stop me from programming", it clicks right afterwards.

So maybe next time I hear that voice whining in the back of my head, I'll welcome it.
